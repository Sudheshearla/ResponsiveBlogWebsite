            <h3 class="title">BHADRAKALI TEMPLE: Symbol of Fortitude and Fierceness<span>Glory</span></h3>
            <p class="text">The temple is believed to be built in 625 A.D by the King Pulakeshin II of Chalukya dynasty to commemorate his victory over Vengi region of Andhra Desham, as per the writings on the temple wall.

Kakatiya kings later have adopted the temple and considered Goddess Bhadrakali as their kuladevata. A lake was also built by Ganapati-deva adjacent to the temple. Due to the fall of Kakatiya dynasty to the Muslim rulers of Delhi, the temple lost its prominence. The Kakatiyas negotiated a truce with Allauddin Khilji by offering the diamond in exchange not to be invaded. He sent his slave and personal confidant Malik Kufur to personally transport the diamond. In 1950, the temple was renovated by Sri Ganesh Rao Sastri a devi upasaka along with Gujrati businessman Shri Maganlal.

After that the help of a local public and other affluent locals.Apara Ekadashi is observed as Goddess Bhadrakali Ekadashi.The history of the Koh-i-Noor diamond; part of British Crown Jewels, is closely associated with this temple as it was installed, as the left eye of Goddess Bhadrakali by the Kakatiya dynasty.</p>

            <h3 class="title">THOUSAND PILLARS TEMPLE : Symbol of Proud Heritage!</h3>
            <p class="text">Many Hindu temples were developed under the patronage of Ganapati Deva, Rudrama Devi and Prataparudra who were of Kakatiya dynasty. The Thousand Pillar Temple was believed to be constructed during the period between 1175â€“1324 CE by order of the king, Rudra Deva. It stands out to be a masterpiece and achieved major heights in terms of architectural skills by the ancient Kakatiya Vishwakarma Sthapathis (Architect). The Executive officer of the subject temple is P.Venugopal.

It was desecrated by the Tughlaq dynasty during their invasion of the Deccan.[citation needed]

However, the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad,(Mir Osman Ali Khan) donated a grant of 1 Lakh INR towards the reconstruction of this temple.</p>

            <h3 class="title">PADMAKSHI TEMPLE: ANNAKONDA PILLAR</h3>
            <p class="text">The site originally had a Shaivite cave temple. The artificial caves, located to the west of the present-day temple, were probably carved before the 5th century CE, as they are almost identical to the early Brahmanical caves. A Jain shrine was probably added during the rule of the Chalukyas of Vatapi or the Rashtrakutas.

A 1117 CE inscription found at the temple records the construction of a Jain shrine named Kadalalaya-basadi, and a gift of land to this shrine.[2] The site probably already had Jain presence by this time. Mailama, the wife of the Kakatiya minister Betana-pergada, commissioned the shrine. Medarasa of Ugravadi (Meda II), who held the office of Maha-mandaleshvara, donated the land. Betana was a minister of the Kakatiya chief Prola II, who was a Shaivite and a vassal of the Chalukyas of Kalyani.Ugravadi appears to be the name of a historical region comprising the present-day Mulugu and Narasampet talukas.

Probably sometime after the 1156 CE, the Brahmanical shrine replaced the Jain shrine, possibly due to the influence of the Veerashaivas. In the 19th century, the Jains appealed to the Nizam of Hyderabad to grant them the control of the site, arguing that it was originally a Jain shrine. The Nizam instituted a commission to investigate the Jain claim, and concluded that the earliest shrine at the site belonged to the Hindus. In 1869 CE, the Nizam granted land for the maintenance of the temple.

Architecture
An impressive feature of the temple is the four faces of the Annakonda pillar, which is a quadrangular column made of black granite stone at the temple's entrance.

The temple has rich sculpture of the Jain Tirthankaras and other Jain gods and goddesses.

Once a year, Lakhs of women arrive to celebrate the famous Bathukamma festival and immerse flowers in the pond at the foot of the Padmakshi hillock.</p>
